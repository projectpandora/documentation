To create a new scan:

1. Click the **Scans** navigation in the top header.

2. Press **Add new** button on the scan list page.

3. Select mode for the new scan. Currrently, we supports 3 modes:

   - **Full scan**: Use all modules along with their recommended configuration. It is suggested that you should use this mode in the first scan of a workspace.
   - **Quick scan**: In this mode, only modules with detecting vulnerabilities capabilities will be run. Very useful for fast response against novel vulnerabilities.
   - **Customize scan**: This is the advanced mode which allows you to customize the scan further. Choose this if you know what you are doing.

4. Select target that you want to scan.

5. Optional step: Choose signatures (quick scan) or configurate moodules (customize scan).

6. Review and click **Create scan** to confirm.
